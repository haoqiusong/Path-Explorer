# Path-Explorer

Path-Explorer is a new suite of user-friendly computational tools that enable reconstruction of co-occurring strains, as well as provide other fundamental analytical capabilities that will enhance metagenomic-based WBS of various pathogen and antimicrobial resistance targets.

# Installation & Usage

## Requirements

1. Linux Operating System
2. Conda

## Installation

"""
git clone https://github.com/haoqiusong/Path-Explorer.git
cd read-pipeline
bash install.sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
"""

## (A). Read mapping to quantify pathogen and ARG markers of interest

## (B). De novo assembly to assess potential new pathogen variants and to determine “resistome risk” (i.e., degree to which ARGs have propensity to spread to pathogens)

## (C). Strain-resolved pathogen detection
